                <h1>Why do I even exist here?</h1>
                <p>For several years now, I've spent many hours questioning the meaning of my existence, and as most humans do, will probably continue doing so for the rest of my life. I've never been satisfied by any one explaination I've heard other people give. Not that anyone else is wrong, in fact, I'm probably miserably wrong with my ideas. But only time will really tell about that. But there are a few ideas I found I could build on. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We <em>could</em>, but are not necessairly alone in this universe. The existence of a god is possible, but unknowable.</li>
                    <li>We live for a short amount of time, in the timescale of the univserse, astronomically tiny amount of time.</li>
                    <li>All events before our existence has led up to our existence.</li>
                    <li>Once we are dead, our existence becomes increasingly diffuse, eventually leaving little trace of our existence.</li>
                    <li>There is no known possible way to alter any part of the previous ideas, while staying here, in our existence.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>With that in mind, my one idea on the reason I exist here is simply so that I can participate in the transformation of the universe, from it's initial to final state. I exist here just to rearrange some matter, produce information, and express that information in ways that allows for other matter with intelligence to rearrange matter in different ways accordingly. It's a depressing prospect on life, but I'm only human, and will only ever be human, so I guess this is it. I can enjoy my existence, and help provide to the future, but no matter what, once I'm done, I'm done, and my actions do have some form of finality in that once they are done, the effects on the universe will be tiny, but existent.</p>
                <p>It does make me wonder though, what kind of torture would life be if any one of these didn't apply. Imagine actually being God, or a god, doomed to exist and have the ability to modify the universe forever. Never being able to just pick a time to give up, knowing that no matter what, yet another day you will exist. For a human, that would eventually lead to complete insanity. The monotony of the universe, always moving along at a steady pace, creating civilizations to watch them tear eachother apart. Creating patterns that create fascinating things in the univserse, just to watch them be disassembled eventually. Eventually, one would be driven crazy by everything. But then , a god also is unlikely to have any human like experiences, so it's futile to imagine anything from a god's perspective, other than the permanence of their existence.</p>
                <p>As much as I despair existentially to my limited lifespan, and the fact of the inevitablity of death, I'm glad it exists.</p>
